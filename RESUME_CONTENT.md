## üí° Interview Talking Points:

1. **Technical Depth**: "I built this system with production quality in mind - notice the abstract base class pattern that makes it easy to add new model types, and the comprehensive testing that gives us confidence in deployment."

2. **Business Understanding**: "The walk-forward validation was crucial because financial time-series data has unique challenges - we can't use future data to predict the past, so I implemented a 40-day retrain cycle that mirrors real trading conditions."

3. **Scalability**: "The modular architecture means we can easily extend this to multiple symbols, different timeframes, or even different trading strategies by just swapping components."

4. **Production Readiness**: "Every component has proper error handling, logging, and monitoring. The MLflow integration means we can track experiments and roll back models if needed."
